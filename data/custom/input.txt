welcome to the GSB show [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you thank you I'm shalina this is this is Hannah Evie and Logan [Applause] and we're the NBA 2 show exec team [Applause] we have an amazing production for you tonight you might be wondering can an original musical about business school really be that good [Applause] we had a lot of family fly in tonight including my parents so we hope so [Applause] and if it's terrible we want to truly apologize to Rachel's father in the audience tonight who flew in from Everest Base Camp to be here 140 members of the GSB Community gave their time and talent to make this night possible and we did the math our cast spent a total of 1 921 hours in rehearsal and that number grows when you add in our fabulous dancers and live bands and they got paid zero dollars I never thought I'd say this at the GSB but they don't care about money they just want to be the center of attention so cheer for your friends tonight and they're going to give you the performance of a lifetime [Applause] and don't worry we got approval on all the jokes I know I speak for the entire cast and crew of the 2023 GSB show when I say we cannot wait to show you what we've been working on for the last year but before we do that want to give a few personal thank yous to people who you will not see on stage today but who really made today happen uh so first to our wonderful faculty advisor Juan Guzman [Applause] one despite working for the administration you ended up being our biggest supporter [Music] so thank you for all that you do this show would have been happening in M109 without you to our friends over at the Fox Theater [Music] every year four new versions of us show up and still don't know how to run a show or do Lighting and Sound so thank you for your patience and we hope the alcohol sales from tonight will pay for your overtime to our wonderful production management team ikshita Kathy will Kurt Brian Damien you all took an 80-page Google doc that we dumped in your lap and created a whole world out of it and I'm so thrilled that everyone here will get to see all of your hard work come alive to our live bands Marie [Applause] the energy you bring to the music takes our show to the next level and thank you for your patience with all of us as we tried to hum the parts of the songs that we're referencing to our writer's room if you are offended by any of the jokes today chances are they wrote it and not us happy to share specific names as well but in all seriousness the script the jokes the lyrics would not be where they are today without you so thank you to our wonderful choreographers Mac Nancy Viv Jocelyn Cordelia [Applause] you all took a bunch of ex-consultants and recovering Finance Bros with zero hand-eye coordination and somehow made them look good on stage so thank you for that and finally it breaks my heart for the NBA one exact team Sadie Divine Michael Peter [Music] [Applause] [Music] we could not be leaving the show in better hands this has been a ride of a lifetime doing this with you and I can't wait to see where you take it next year so what is this show all about foreign [Music] [Applause] sat down nearly a year ago and spoke about our vision for the show this year we knew we wanted to create something big something ambitious something that could rival you know even Frank Ocean set at Coachella which at the time felt ambitious but you know times change um we wanted to make you laugh we wanted to make you feel something and we also really didn't want to get canceled in 10 years so fingers crossed on that Dimension um this show begun as a scribble on a whiteboard in p109 and that scribble became a show outline and the outline became a script um and at the end of all of that what we were left with was the story of a guy who with enough hard work and ambition became a founding father of the United States of I I'm so that's Hamilton I I'm I'm sorry no that's not their show um actually what we wanted to answer was what really makes a GSB is it getting the call from Dean Moss is it something intrinsic to who you are or is it something about being here being part of this community that really transforms you [Music] [Applause] we wanted each one of you students and SOS and faculty and Americans and Internationals to see yourselves represented on the stage because the one thing we all have in common is that we didn't get comfortable overnight but what if every time you felt like an imposter you realized everyone else did too [Applause] [Music] so to bring this production and this story to life required that the four of us walk in March step and to illustrate how good we how well we did that I want to share some texts from this morning Evie we need to get thank you cards for the NBA ones Hannah we already did you just need to sign them Logan should we get them alcohol Shelina we already did check your email but the point is this well Evie and I could play the role of frantic creatives Hannah and Shelina managed a million pieces large and small hundreds of people over a number of months and if you don't think that's amazing you know how hard it is to get a one-on-one coffee with anyone at the GSB now I don't want to stand between you and I I don't want to stand between you and the show so I'll keep this brief but I want to answer one more question why did we spend so much time on the show why did we spend thousands of hours Wednesdays and Sundays rehearsing while all of you were studying and network well watching secession and doing mushrooms that you're passed down I don't know um why did we spend this time and for me the answer is it was an opportunity to connect with amazing people at the GSB it was the opportunity to express myself and I had to make a point to Professor Wesley Hartman who I had for creativity and business who gave me an LP so I think this is pretty creative dude how many shows have you done Wesley Hartman [Applause] thank you [Applause] but but why did we all do this we did this because we care about you we did this because we want to show you that and we thought we thought your love language might be a really long overproduced amateur musical theater production and [Music] um no but but really why did we do this we did this because we care about you this is a gift from all of us to our professors to our parents to our class it's an expression of Love An expression of gratitude for making the past few years exceptionally special so we hope you enjoy it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] today is the day man I hope I get the call I want to make a million new friends obviously this phone call thing is just designed to soak our anxiety and make us feel special if we get in but man it would be great Mom and Dad you'll see I'll get the call I'll finally make you proud Ryan was that it was that the call ah well good luck I'm off to the hospital oh Mondays inspired probably fine [Applause] they are eat everything to get in check it again can't believe today's the day will I get my NBA [Applause] it's got pedigree [Applause] just need one thing to complete the Legacy It's

curse and think I'm cool I just wanna go to school I just wanna go to school please like Kirsten think I'm cool I just wanna go to school all right [Applause] I act like I just doing fine but honestly I really want this after all God I hope I get the call Ryan settle in your shadow but they don't know I'm a star in my own right saving lives all day and night [Applause] I just wanted to get in cause his skin is kind of thin feeling I just wanna go to school [Applause] [Music] another day [Music] nothing special just eat my bagel is that the time I'm late gotta run the train won't wait I don't wanna go to school NBA's are kind of tools applications interviews that sounds so hard so Uncle short sometimes when I am bored I wonder if I want more should I take some risks again [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] midnight already can you believe school starts in just 10 hours it always sneaks up on you will you say a few words Dean Levin well I once met Rishi sunog about the new year we've heard enough about your love for Richie okay well as is tradition we welcome the students with Scotch cheers so Dean Moss what can you tell us about your latest batch wow they are just phenomenal I know I say this every year but this year they really take my breath away [Music] [Applause] honestly it's the same every year a hundred kids who want to solve climate change but for some reason need to work in finance or Consulting first [Music] you have no idea how hard my job is to really see beyond a resume and then filter by GMAT School and then by parents donations right this is why I'm joining an ashram each year I meticulously read through 8 000 essays searching for that it Factor ambition kind and diverse manifestations of type A neuroses [Music] I could do it I could do it hang on you're not really saying you could do Dean Moss's job that's exactly what I'm saying I mean really just a simple application of my research on social dynamics help take a stranger off the Caltrain and make them a geosphere oh yeah you care to make a friendly wager what are your terms if you can take a stranger off the Caltrain and make them a GS beer for one year tenure is yours and if I fail you have to teach ethics [Applause] for the rest of your academic career wait wait but how will we know if it's like I mean if Haley Jones can make it to graduation one can for you to get tenure this person must become a part of our community I'll be the judge of that and you just have to trust me without getting cooked and then Tanya deal [Applause] [Music] thank you where is my ta Mal [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good morning professor oh you're drunk drunk I'm getting Tanya you are going to help me pass a stranger as a GSB student so we get 10 well me we'll still get minimum wage and no one will know your name until course evaluations so how are we or who to pick don't you [Applause] now

[Music] YouTube [Music] [Music] well now you've done it just when you'd found a place that mattered had a purpose it all blows up no more risks bear wait wait guys I told you I can't come back one more thing one two three four [Music] [Applause] and so sad put up a fight you told me lies so we argued so we thought yeah we did it before but now we've seen the light the truth is that we really need you it's too soon you can't go back to the city I know that you miss a GFC let me put in my feed just come back here with me yeah this school started out lonely but now we're a family and yeah you really hurt us by lying about who you were but we found what I want [Applause] look I know that you can see what makes you fit but it's not getting in that's not it the great engine that they don't mean cause you make me happy when I'm feeling crappy you tell me that's life when I'm stressing a bit you'll be okay you really saw me for the Spencer I could be a better guy let's not be in a part of the bourgeoisie big school started out lonely but now we're a family and yeah you really hurt us by lying about who you were but we found [Music] I found people who love me they don't care about my CV cause I miss your face here no Stanford sweater or Harvard hat I barely recognize you trying to stand on my own two feet I suppose what's changed I feel awful for what I did to you I don't know I was taking out some of my own insecurities it's okay Spencer I I get it no really it wasn't fair for me to dig into your past like that or to out him to the whole school by telling the update writers wait it's okay Steph Spencer I forgive you no really like whoever told the update writers it wasn't me really then who did [Music] it thank you [Music] foreign [Music] I was so close so close object failure your little experiment didn't even make it to summer break goodbye Tanya hello ethics I told you my job was hard without my Steady Hand it'd be like Lord of the Flies out there or Worse HBS [Applause] [Music] he's kind of back we all went to the Caltrain and begged him to come back what yeah we did a musical number everything leaving um [Music] just as I had hoped as you had hoped what are you saying professor and could you maybe say it in rishi's dreamy accent I'm gonna count the terms of our bet well you had to take a stranger off the Caltrain and pass him as a GS beer for a year exactly and you're saying you've done that well I certainly think so but but it does beg the question what is a geosphere oh hi IQ and higher anxiety no no no no I've got it wasn't cool in high school or college but still optimistic anyway um a desire to Virtue signal at the highest level no stop none of that is a good test to the geosphere then what is Professor propensity to become a beloved UK political figure didn't they did what what you're a tenure I'm confused precisely for tenia that I did it Mel you see if fear was a gsbf through and through they'd never let him go and they didn't he's one of them he would he was just some random guy on the Caltrain he gave up his seat when I got on a small indication that he'd be a giver but yes mostly random oh now it's your tenure on Monday come celebrate with me whoa so what's the point of all this being at the GSB doesn't make us special we're undiscerning about who we befriend on behalf of others who are tired drunk and losing focus I'd like you to wrap this up neatly for me [Applause] well now getting in doesn't make you a geosphere and getting to graduation doesn't make you a GS beer either what makes you a geosphere is the impact you have while you're here and what you do next [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] worth it worth it all right I gotta go to bed I'm off to SF tomorrow but we'll see you back in the fall I put the deposit down on our pass down so I guess I don't really have a choice I cannot believe this year is over it has just flown by but hey this is just the start of something great for us for [Applause] as I was saying this is just the this is just gonna be a great start for us [Music] [Applause] [Music] or clicks there's something that sticks always we know not just in this show what we've built here will last past two years no matter how we all got here wherever we go this is [Music] foreign that's two LPs they left me readings I don't do cold calls are cool if it's not you personal growth at Vegas foam patio shots Carry Me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] PL talk jmac rooftop touchy feely fear the country [Music] [Music] now we must go now we must go it's the end of the show [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello [Music] in the morning [Music] in the middle of the night [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] myself [Music] [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]

foreign [Music] thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign we haven't even said anything yet geez friends people I don't like total strangers who have nothing better to do on a Friday night welcome to the 2022 GSB show let's Circle that I'm Kevin helgren and I'm joined and I'm joined on stage by Kevin Wittenberg [Music] Julianne Howell and Lucas zelnick and the four of us together along with a whole host of other folks you'll see and hear from throughout the night have had the absolute honor of producing and directing the GSB show this year and tonight's special for a couple reasons first tonight marks the first time in two years that the GSB show is happening live and in person yes that means you're gonna see real people singing and dancing on the stage we didn't bus you to Redwood City to watch a movie in this theater which we felt compelled to clarify because if you've taught us anything this week it's that you don't read your [ __ ] emails yes we're providing Transportation yes there is an after party and no you may not bring a bag in unless it's clear although that last rule was certainly skirted tonight um amazing the the other reason that tonight's important is because this marks the first restriction free GSB wide event since the pandemic started that's right in one room we've got NBA ones we've got NBA twos we even have msxers we have come a very long way since green vests and campus compact violations and the GSB show could not be more thrilled to welcome you all to what we know is going to be the most incredible Spring quarter okay since it's been so long that we've been together in person a couple ground rules the biggest thing is everybody who you're about to see tonight work their asses off to put this on for you so that level of enthusiasm is amazing all the energy you give to them they will give right back to you please just don't like Heckle any like full phrases out because that [ __ ] us up and uh uh yeah just don't do that don't go on your phones if you need to take a call or use the bathroom just step out of the theater to do that definitely step out of the theater to use the bathroom you don't you don't want to do that here that's a lot um the other thing is we have a long night ahead of us so Pace yourselves the GSB show is many things but it is not short laughs is it the length of Hamilton yes yes it is is it as good as Hamilton 100 yes it is better it's better it's it's better lin-manuel Miranda socks I'll say it okay um the last part is we will have like a 25 minute intermission we'll have some dancers please support our dancers the bar will also reopen and then we have the after party and the very last thing I want to say is uh a lot of people are gonna get roasted tonight everyone who is getting roasted has been notified and they have signed off on the joke so just cool it okay it's fine it's fine have fun laugh and that's it for me that was an off microphone oh there we are hello everyone so just to let you in a little bit on the creative process of this year's show when we all got together and we thought about what the show would be and what it would mean to us we thought about the time we were spending at the GSB how the last year with the pandemic and our Zoom Bas just had flown by um and I also thought about how I talked to my mom who was here tonight about the way that I've spent my time in my MBA getting to know all you wonderful people having like a lovely time and you know she said to me that's how you're spending your MBA just a couple too many trips to Tahoe um and so I think we all thought to ourselves this time is going so fast um what if we could do it over again what if we had more time here um what would we do differently what would we do instead what if we had no risks how would we spend our time here and I think this is on all of our minds as we go as the mba2s go into the last uh little stretch of spring quarter graduation approaching uh and NBA ones look to kind of the halfway point of their experience in msx's I don't know where you are on your journey um but there's probably a lot on your mind too um so anyway that was all on our minds uh and we decided to care pour our hearts into the show uh and hopefully make it funny the four of us came up with this vision for show almost a year ago but it has taken the hard work of over 100 people in this community to put on the full-scale production that you'll see tonight towards you so to all the people behind the scenes or performing tonight whether you're in our band a dancer in the cast or on our leadership team we owe you the biggest Round of Applause this house can give you and we truly encourage everyone to read through the full program to see every name that was involved in show tonight there are a few names that we need to call out individually first of all Sam Linville literally designed the artwork on the program and we forgot to put his name in the program so Sam Linville thank you for your heart and spoiler alert that's not the last mistake you're gonna see tonight but it's the first one additionally our faculty advisor Juan Guzman we entered this year we entered this year wondering what is the point of the administration at all uh just kidding Hey Dean Levin hi denoyer it's great to have you guys here no it really is great to have you here but want to go Juan Guzman has changed our perspective completely and we've all become converts you have absolutely found your calling and you've been our champion from day one thank you for making this show happen we could not have done it without you and last but not least our Replacements better and virtually every way than the four of us our NBA one team Hannah Selena Evie and Logan we could not be leaving the show in better hands you guys have brought it in every way um you have shown us so much about leading a show uh things we should have been showing you but we are very very grateful for it and we can't wait to see the show that you guys put on we know it's going to be absolutely incredible so thank you for your hard work this night is yours as much as ours without further Ado we present to you the 2022 GSB show let's Circle back everyone thank you [Music] [Applause] did you see the head of the EPA drives a car the hypocrisy goes all the way to the top well maybe it's a Tesla great more money for Elon a union bust and Pander to The Joe Rogan demo not everything has to be a cause River yeah but how are we supposed to change lives change organizations and change the world if we can't even change Sea World and that is just a world for the sea what Blackfish was just so beautiful oh [Music] [Applause] God I'm so sick of Nobu breakfast but this killer whale Crudo though delicious so pumped for this weekend you know this will be my first time in Kenya oh nice wait so where do you Safari then and did you not go on the Africa Track Africa I don't have

sure you want to get this one oh it's going on the corporate card you still have access to that oh no no that's just what I call Daddy's card foreign [Applause] why does networking suck too many unimpressive people yes so true so what's your pitch I want to start the first networking series with almost no people trim the fat I like it say more application only five people maxed as few as one catered oh like a small group dinner but obviously in a way more Innovative disruptive way [Music] [Applause] [Music] Natalie I'm okay lately I'm just feeling like these past two years haven't been

playing right at the outcome everyone down to just get through it really fast yeah yep should we start with a quick round of introductions we're literally about to graduate we've all met right classic parsippian French everyone knows he went to Yale says the guy who wore Harvard geared a state school phone saying guys folks probably would have been better anyway my name's River my pronouns are he him his and I believe that everyone should be welcome in this room which is situated on lands previously occupied by The mulawake One Tribe who by the way just lost a federal lawsuit to be recognized but I recognize them I'm Nathan I dabble in everything recently I read a couple blogs and did an eight-week internship so now I'm a product thought leader and Eliza a McKinsey consultant I actually started my own education platform and I've told you that before okay now that we've all been reintroduced let's get started I love to see that fire from you thanks I hate that can we get started now all right well if you're all afraid to be known we can get rolling who wants to be the CEO let the record state that I conscientiously object and strongly feel that companies should be run by communes

graced from the CMC thinks is insane and I have offered a hundred thousand dollars I'd like to kick those off by saying my new offer is ninety thousand dollars never push a CEO okay 90 it is really yup sounds good you got me and seen how is that guys oh oh well well done well are we set I do want to stress this reinforces the pervacity of the unequal power dynamics between men and women I hope you own that Eliza yep definitely a lot of perversity going on around here all right wait wait hold on you have to give us something take this like 10 as seriously as Kieran Kenny took eye job no this role play is about as mandatory as our Dei training back in school I studied far too high anyway regardless [Music] [Applause] if I had the urge to try it's not like I can join the world [Music] [Music] yeah sounds crazy when the faculty they try even less steal all the cases [Applause] [Music] great non-disclosure is made for me my GPA is here I am here [Music] [Music] I'm trying to be y'all

round two you mean why aren't more parties pyramid schemes was was radcella a pyramid scheme that's not how you define it it costs about three thousand dollars but you could bring that cost down by inviting other people oh so like the definition of a pyramid scheme yes but at least Conrad and Sachin made a personal financial profit by doing it uh-huh yep glad I missed that one I was a motel tier invite anyway don't worry there's always next time maybe Drake will plan another trip to Dubai to clear one billion Hotel points yo I got you a spicy claw let's go what's that a wide claw shotgun with

Alex we've been to Nobu what three days in a row now which frankly isn't unusual for us but she thinks it's just been one day I've now been on the verge of creating my own one-person catered networking event for three days now isn't that just a solo dinner it's so much more than that but that's not the point you all are the only other three that know what's going on yeah everyone else thinks I'm crazy have you guys seen Groundhog Day are you insinuating that I don't know what I'm insinuating but are we not stuck in a loop repeating the same day like Palm Springs with Andy Sandberg oh you've seen that movie of course it's a Charming blend of nihilism and romance what's not to like okay let's say we are stuck how do we get unstuck well in Groundhog Day he got out through like Karma and in Palm Springs I think they blew themselves up with a bomb maybe we try the karma thing first although how can it be karma for me I posted a black Square on Instagram back in 2020. well if I'm being honest you all phoned it in on the role play yesterday right right right so if we do if we come and do what we came here to do and do it well do you all think you're capable of doing it well well of course we're [ __ ] capable fine you guys try God this is just classic get stuck in a Time Loop right before my trip to Kenya honestly I think God doesn't want me to party in Kenya well I don't believe in God but if she existed [Applause] [Music] I'm sure that would be the case recipient you know I think Dean Levin would tell you to be more Curious than judgmental River but Luke why why we want to stay in uh unlimited consequence free time you guys have consequences on to something here River so I personally enjoy it when time moves forward actually that's a good point life out there isn't as good as it is here at the TSB Eliza hear us out The Green Grass Is Always Greener on your best friend's Instagram you dream about New York City just look at Town Square around you potential friendships Galore Jonathan Burke is smiling what pivots you looking for take my money [Applause] while we are drinking and barely thinking at GST [Music] how do we always [Music] [Music] thank you um [Applause] [Music] even the Libertarians sometimes will play contrarian we all have advics though they're prosthetic at GSB that learn to bet the doc learned to talk the boss learned to goss and they [ __ ] rock the Juke learned to fluke the Quant learn to flaunt the harder the art of brands [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] what if we got a lot of time I guess it's pretty damn Sublime [Music] each NBA here making their names here at GSB each little meter expert case reader that's why it's better in gorgeous weather yeah we're good luckier women don't suck here [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] hey man this is where I usually sit did you just join this class or something this is my seat now oh oh okay that was surprisingly liberating I don't know if I've ever told somebody no at the GSP before hey um is that my drink I was looking for it on the rack outside Koopa and I couldn't find it no well um your drink has my name written on the side of it see it says Haley Lee right there binders Keepers Nathan that's mine can I have my dirty try with lima bean milk back foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] point we have a lot of water news today Paul Warrior is going to kill me okay so let's get right into today's case is McKenzie ethical [Applause] as someone working there this summer unquestionably yes you're a monster in fact you're all awful especially you the MS excerpt yeah last quarter you wasted hours of my life rambling about absolutely nothing in class and you're so old why are you so old I'm only 37. Professor if I may be so bold this is all foreplay let's skip to the good part the cast speaker yeah cut to the chase because we're here for top okay so our guest tonight is the CEO and founder of Toms the shoe cup one model please welcome Blake mykoski [Applause] thank you thank you everyone thank you let's just jump right into the questions yeah you so I believe that shoe drops destroy local economies I have two questions my first one is who Do You Think You Are and my second is how dare you look we're a very Mission focused company it's okay I'll talk to you offline uh yeah you I love Toms I wear Toms um I was just wondering what are you looking for in an intern this is not related to my internship hunt or anything I'm sure it's not I'm not this transparent jockeying for attention isn't networking you're basically holding our guest speaker hostage networking is about to finesse it's seduction and playing the long game let's be honest Prof none of us here did any of the readings and we're all arrogant enough to think that you faculty have nothing to teach us we're aware [Laughter] [Applause] please please you are being disruptive no no yeah [ __ ] off Glenn and then I'm going to call security and they will ask me ask you nicely but not so nicely well since you asked nicely you'll never take us alive [Applause] foreign I did so many shrooms I think I saw a god River and I finally did whatever we wanted to do in class and I've developed one of the largest Venture backable ideation funnels in history I've tried every angle but there's still no way to pass the OB 206 final I gotta say murder not as therapeutic as I thought it 'd be holy [ __ ] you murdered someone look if you watched enough of his tick tocks you'd murder John who too all right this has been fun but I'm ready to get out of here agreed should we do the role play I'm one step ahead of you so Eliza as you know we're here to negotiate your salary as a fresh grad from the GSB you've asked for five hundred thousand dollars I'll cut you off right there I'm not here to negotiate I'm here to be appropriately compensated for the value I add to this team [Applause] foreign [ __ ] Natalie I'm sorry I'll call you back do we have to sing this song every [ __ ] time [Applause] okay so acing the role play did not work we really are stuck in a Time Loop huh and it's really just us four not exactly an All-Star team either not as bad as the startup garage team for people who couldn't find peanut butter in a grocery store but you know not good hey man can we just work together on this oh yeah the rich guy what a man of the people excuse me what's that supposed to mean capitalism not exactly a team sport oh because private Equity is God's work oh my God I'm literally facing eternity with a rich kid a woke guy who's honestly probably a closet Republican and a Raging Raging sociopath parsippian you can murder me next work Natalie I would stay and talk but I have to go so I can figure out how to make tomorrow tomorrow instead of yesterday or today oh you sound crazy Natalie you sound crazy Eliza phone tonight we're going to Fresno and back but we're 30. what we're 30 years old why are we going on a party bus to Nowhere do we need social validation that badly [Music] Eliza is everything okay you want to get on a glorified school bus with 50 consultants for the millionth time and I'm the weird one hey just wanted to let you know that one spot just opened up for the party bus tonight um if you venmo Kylie right now she'll put your name on the Google Doc no Alex I can't do Nobu again I'll get mercury poisoning at this rate hey hey you sick of this yet to say the least yeah me too I'm gonna go try to convince Baba Schiff to drop acid with me in the cactus garden you want to come sounds awful like Kevin wittenberg's ephemeral tattoo see ya so meet you at the farmers market to protest GMOs around noon let's go bigger bigger let's throw a rally for Bernie Sanders River he's not even running for anything yeah but everyone knows the 2024 election is only two years away plus he'll be 84. the perfect age for our next president or we could do neither of those things and just grab lunch oh yeah strategize no to hang out I'm your girlfriend partner you don't always have to be fighting for something River sometimes you can just be Dean Hayes as you know I as you know I am an extremely important member of this community you're certainly a member of the community and the last thing we'd want is for this school which Andrew Lowe has repeatedly deemed a failure of an institution to fall apart completely oh it won't but continue agreed as long as I am given the resources I need to succeed I would like my own office no and a standing classroom absolutely not view from the top reports to me no it was worth a shot good day oh can confirm that staying up all night does not get us out of here yeah neither does taking the PJ to Israel I just woke back up here and it wasn't even on my story oh wow dumping tons of carbon into the atmosphere didn't get you out of the cosmic time Loop surprise surprise well seems like I'm the only one who thought of reaching out to Neil deGrasse Tyson to get his take and guess what happened you found a way out my email didn't bounce back I'm sure he'll respond tomorrow we're in a Time Loop you [ __ ] dumbass there is no tomorrow that's the whole point look I know it's scary but I think we need to do a suicide pact no way what if we die like for real I guess we'd have to find another CIS white guy to fight for women's rights other than Matt Devine [Applause] someone should die but it increases our risk if we all do it together clearly the group can't afford to lose its most influential members so I'm out you know frankly with advances in technology I think it's possible I never know so it looks like death doesn't matter so that's cool um it sort of mattered in the sense that I had a Shard of windshield glass lodged in my large intestines for 45 minutes while I slowly dripped out of Consciousness oh Jesus man yeah it was really unpleasant to watch well it was really unpleasant to experience too probably not as unpleasant though as when they kicked wurfel off campus for wine noobs right [Applause] I Had A Shard of glass lodged in my intestines it was way way worse so we're really trapped here huh I guess not the worst place to be stuck though right kind of is what no there's so much to love Sun's always shining the buildings all have my family's name on them and Jimmy V's what a great way to take the edge off after a Nobu Omakase hangover how often do you go to Nobu you keep count plus I mean the people here are amazing I met my partner here honestly I don't see what's so amazing about the people here sometimes I feel like Chris didn't matter whatever Dean Moss sometimes I feel like Dean Moss has lost her edge huh really don't like it here do you I mean it's been two years and I haven't figured it out people text me about stuff I'm invited to stuff but when I'm having a [ __ ] day I don't know who to text you're happy though right I mean these are supposed to be two of the best years of Our Lives if by two of the best years you mean two years spent getting drunk and having surface level interactions while revealing just enough about yourself so that you impress your classmates but not enough so that they actually know you sounds like you're nailing it I don't get what the problem is hold on there is real vulnerability here yeah there's a lot that goes right here [Applause] [Music] wreck up stack up shoot the ball isn't all this drinking cool what if button every day how can't you love this movie I've been doing one-on-ones booked up the whole night through I

fault you the social climbing youth I can't fake it that's the truth I'm struggling to share your view [Music] [Applause] yeah yeah [Music] Eliza just shake it off I think you're all up in your head what in your hand what it's starting to piss me off I thought we were becoming friends what aren't we friends I guess it's true it's not like it's a rule I've been blaming you and you for maybe I'm a poop baby I guess it's true there are some things that are cool not every dude a tool I can make it at this school [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah yeah yeah yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

impressing Lucas did you see his bit at open mic night yeah the nicest comments on his tick tocks are that he looks like Brock Turner hey River Caroline broke up with me dude she was on the bus ride from hell though I mean I'm sure it was just the craziness talking yeah but she said it was a long time coming well the nice thing about being in a Time Loop is you can test that hypothesis right that's what I've been doing with startup ideas all week worth shot hey you're happy right what you know like in this relationship you're happy why are you asking me this now because I want you to be happy when did you start wanting that what do you mean do you know what Chobani did for yogurt I want to do that for Peloton what does that mean it's Chobani for Peloton uh that's just a less clear version of what you said before well you loved protesting the local elementary school when they taught their kindergarteners about genders right I mean there are thousands of genders you loved doing that I just loved spending time with you loved patents software is a service what did you say software as a service that's good say more of that for nfts Network effects inside the metaverse exactly

vegan cheeseburger 76 including tip no the other thing you said about the time Loop well if you ever went out all you have to do is ask why would you put us in a Time Loop if all we had to do to get out was ask for someone who works for doordash who happens to have a mystical ability to put people in Eternal time loops and does so at random is that so hard to understand yeah there doesn't have to be a moral buried in every story yeah I mean it's a little hard to understand how how can I find you just order a ton of doordash and you'll find me eventually and by the way did you vote no on Prop 22 classifying gig workers as independent contractors you know I I didn't really understand the policy implications classic have a nice night [Applause] hey how was the line of Jimmy V's oh hey um the
