welcome to the GSB show [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you thank you I'm shalina this is this is Hannah Evie and Logan [Applause] and we're the NBA 2 show exec team [Applause] we have an amazing production for you tonight you might be wondering can an original musical about business school really be that good [Applause] we had a lot of family fly in tonight including my parents so we hope so [Applause] and if it's terrible we want to truly apologize to Rachel's father in the audience tonight who flew in from Everest Base Camp to be here 140 members of the GSB Community gave their time and talent to make this night possible and we did the math our cast spent a total of 1 921 hours in rehearsal and that number grows when you add in our fabulous dancers and live bands and they got paid zero dollars I never thought I'd say this at the GSB but they don't care about money they just want to be the center of attention so cheer for your friends tonight and they're going to give you the performance of a lifetime [Applause] and don't worry we got approval on all the jokes I know I speak for the entire cast and crew of the 2023 GSB show when I say we cannot wait to show you what we've been working on for the last year but before we do that want to give a few personal thank yous to people who you will not see on stage today but who really made today happen uh so first to our wonderful faculty advisor Juan Guzman [Applause] one despite working for the administration you ended up being our biggest supporter [Music] so thank you for all that you do this show would have been happening in M109 without you to our friends over at the Fox Theater [Music] every year four new versions of us show up and still don't know how to run a show or do Lighting and Sound so thank you for your patience and we hope the alcohol sales from tonight will pay for your overtime to our wonderful production management team ikshita Kathy will Kurt Brian Damien you all took an 80-page Google doc that we dumped in your lap and created a whole world out of it and I'm so thrilled that everyone here will get to see all of your hard work come alive to our live bands Marie [Applause] the energy you bring to the music takes our show to the next level and thank you for your patience with all of us as we tried to hum the parts of the songs that we're referencing to our writer's room if you are offended by any of the jokes today chances are they wrote it and not us happy to share specific names as well but in all seriousness the script the jokes the lyrics would not be where they are today without you so thank you to our wonderful choreographers Mac Nancy Viv Jocelyn Cordelia [Applause] you all took a bunch of ex-consultants and recovering Finance Bros with zero hand-eye coordination and somehow made them look good on stage so thank you for that and finally it breaks my heart for the NBA one exact team Sadie Divine Michael Peter [Music] [Applause] [Music] we could not be leaving the show in better hands this has been a ride of a lifetime doing this with you and I can't wait to see where you take it next year so what is this show all about foreign [Music] [Applause] sat down nearly a year ago and spoke about our vision for the show this year we knew we wanted to create something big something ambitious something that could rival you know even Frank Ocean set at Coachella which at the time felt ambitious but you know times change um we wanted to make you laugh we wanted to make you feel something and we also really didn't want to get canceled in 10 years so fingers crossed on that Dimension um this show begun as a scribble on a whiteboard in p109 and that scribble became a show outline and the outline became a script um and at the end of all of that what we were left with was the story of a guy who with enough hard work and ambition became a founding father of the United States of I I'm so that's Hamilton I I'm I'm sorry no that's not their show um actually what we wanted to answer was what really makes a GSB is it getting the call from Dean Moss is it something intrinsic to who you are or is it something about being here being part of this community that really transforms you [Music] [Applause] we wanted each one of you students and SOS and faculty and Americans and Internationals to see yourselves represented on the stage because the one thing we all have in common is that we didn't get comfortable overnight but what if every time you felt like an imposter you realized everyone else did too [Applause] [Music] so to bring this production and this story to life required that the four of us walk in March step and to illustrate how good we how well we did that I want to share some texts from this morning Evie we need to get thank you cards for the NBA ones Hannah we already did you just need to sign them Logan should we get them alcohol Shelina we already did check your email but the point is this well Evie and I could play the role of frantic creatives Hannah and Shelina managed a million pieces large and small hundreds of people over a number of months and if you don't think that's amazing you know how hard it is to get a one-on-one coffee with anyone at the GSB now I don't want to stand between you and I I don't want to stand between you and the show so I'll keep this brief but I want to answer one more question why did we spend so much time on the show why did we spend thousands of hours Wednesdays and Sundays rehearsing while all of you were studying and network well watching secession and doing mushrooms that you're passed down I don't know um why did we spend this time and for me the answer is it was an opportunity to connect with amazing people at the GSB it was the opportunity to express myself and I had to make a point to Professor Wesley Hartman who I had for creativity and business who gave me an LP so I think this is pretty creative dude how many shows have you done Wesley Hartman [Applause] thank you [Applause] but but why did we all do this we did this because we care about you we did this because we want to show you that and we thought we thought your love language might be a really long overproduced amateur musical theater production and [Music] um no but but really why did we do this we did this because we care about you this is a gift from all of us to our professors to our parents to our class it's an expression of Love An expression of gratitude for making the past few years exceptionally special so we hope you enjoy it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] today is the day man I hope I get the call I want to make a million new friends obviously this phone call thing is just designed to soak our anxiety and make us feel special if we get in but man it would be great Mom and Dad you'll see I'll get the call I'll finally make you proud Ryan was that it was that the call ah well good luck I'm off to the hospital oh Mondays inspired probably fine [Applause] they are eat everything to get in check it again can't believe today's the day will I get my NBA [Applause] it's got pedigree [Applause] just need one thing to complete the Legacy It's

curse and think I'm cool I just wanna go to school I just wanna go to school please like Kirsten think I'm cool I just wanna go to school all right [Applause] I act like I just doing fine but honestly I really want this after all God I hope I get the call Ryan settle in your shadow but they don't know I'm a star in my own right saving lives all day and night [Applause] I just wanted to get in cause his skin is kind of thin feeling I just wanna go to school [Applause] [Music] another day [Music] nothing special just eat my bagel is that the time I'm late gotta run the train won't wait I don't wanna go to school NBA's are kind of tools applications interviews that sounds so hard so Uncle short sometimes when I am bored I wonder if I want more should I take some risks again [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] midnight already can you believe school starts in just 10 hours it always sneaks up on you will you say a few words Dean Levin well I once met Rishi sunog about the new year we've heard enough about your love for Richie okay well as is tradition we welcome the students with Scotch cheers so Dean Moss what can you tell us about your latest batch wow they are just phenomenal I know I say this every year but this year they really take my breath away [Music] [Applause] honestly it's the same every year a hundred kids who want to solve climate change but for some reason need to work in finance or Consulting first [Music] you have no idea how hard my job is to really see beyond a resume and then filter by GMAT School and then by parents donations right this is why I'm joining an ashram each year I meticulously read through 8 000 essays searching for that it Factor ambition kind and diverse manifestations of type A neuroses [Music] I could do it I could do it hang on you're not really saying you could do Dean Moss's job that's exactly what I'm saying I mean really just a simple application of my research on social dynamics help take a stranger off the Caltrain and make them a geosphere oh yeah you care to make a friendly wager what are your terms if you can take a stranger off the Caltrain and make them a GS beer for one year tenure is yours and if I fail you have to teach ethics [Applause] for the rest of your academic career wait wait but how will we know if it's like I mean if Haley Jones can make it to graduation one can for you to get tenure this person must become a part of our community I'll be the judge of that and you just have to trust me without getting cooked and then Tanya deal [Applause] [Music] thank you where is my ta Mal [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good morning professor oh you're drunk drunk I'm getting Tanya you are going to help me pass a stranger as a GSB student so we get 10 well me we'll still get minimum wage and no one will know your name until course evaluations so how are we or who to pick don't you [Applause] now

[Music] YouTube [Music] [Music] well now you've done it just when you'd found a place that mattered had a purpose it all blows up no more risks bear wait wait guys I told you I can't come back one more thing one two three four [Music] [Applause] and so sad put up a fight you told me lies so we argued so we thought yeah we did it before but now we've seen the light the truth is that we really need you it's too soon you can't go back to the city I know that you miss a GFC let me put in my feed just come back here with me yeah this school started out lonely but now we're a family and yeah you really hurt us by lying about who you were but we found what I want [Applause] look I know that you can see what makes you fit but it's not getting in that's not it the great engine that they don't mean cause you make me happy when I'm feeling crappy you tell me that's life when I'm stressing a bit you'll be okay you really saw me for the Spencer I could be a better guy let's not be in a part of the bourgeoisie big school started out lonely but now we're a family and yeah you really hurt us by lying about who you were but we found [Music] I found people who love me they don't care about my CV cause I miss your face here no Stanford sweater or Harvard hat I barely recognize you trying to stand on my own two feet I suppose what's changed I feel awful for what I did to you I don't know I was taking out some of my own insecurities it's okay Spencer I I get it no really it wasn't fair for me to dig into your past like that or to out him to the whole school by telling the update writers wait it's okay Steph Spencer I forgive you no really like whoever told the update writers it wasn't me really then who did [Music] it thank you [Music] foreign [Music] I was so close so close object failure your little experiment didn't even make it to summer break goodbye Tanya hello ethics I told you my job was hard without my Steady Hand it'd be like Lord of the Flies out there or Worse HBS [Applause] [Music] he's kind of back we all went to the Caltrain and begged him to come back what yeah we did a musical number everything leaving um [Music] just as I had hoped as you had hoped what are you saying professor and could you maybe say it in rishi's dreamy accent I'm gonna count the terms of our bet well you had to take a stranger off the Caltrain and pass him as a GS beer for a year exactly and you're saying you've done that well I certainly think so but but it does beg the question what is a geosphere oh hi IQ and higher anxiety no no no no I've got it wasn't cool in high school or college but still optimistic anyway um a desire to Virtue signal at the highest level no stop none of that is a good test to the geosphere then what is Professor propensity to become a beloved UK political figure didn't they did what what you're a tenure I'm confused precisely for tenia that I did it Mel you see if fear was a gsbf through and through they'd never let him go and they didn't he's one of them he would he was just some random guy on the Caltrain he gave up his seat when I got on a small indication that he'd be a giver but yes mostly random oh now it's your tenure on Monday come celebrate with me whoa so what's the point of all this being at the GSB doesn't make us special we're undiscerning about who we befriend on behalf of others who are tired drunk and losing focus I'd like you to wrap this up neatly for me [Applause] well now getting in doesn't make you a geosphere and getting to graduation doesn't make you a GS beer either what makes you a geosphere is the impact you have while you're here and what you do next [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] worth it worth it all right I gotta go to bed I'm off to SF tomorrow but we'll see you back in the fall I put the deposit down on our pass down so I guess I don't really have a choice I cannot believe this year is over it has just flown by but hey this is just the start of something great for us for [Applause] as I was saying this is just the this is just gonna be a great start for us [Music] [Applause] [Music] or clicks there's something that sticks always we know not just in this show what we've built here will last past two years no matter how we all got here wherever we go this is [Music] foreign that's two LPs they left me readings I don't do cold calls are cool if it's not you personal growth at Vegas foam patio shots Carry Me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] PL talk jmac rooftop touchy feely fear the country [Music] [Music] now we must go now we must go it's the end
